<h3>Price Landing Page</h3>
<p>The repository price-landing-demo likely contains the code for the price landing page of CineFlix's website. <br>
  This landing page is designed to showcase the various subscription packs available for users to watch movies. The page features three main subscription packs: mobile, super, and premium.<br><br>
One notable feature of the landing page is the toggle bar, which allows users to dynamically adjust the prices displayed based on their preferences or requirements. This toggle bar likely enables users to select different subscription durations or features, and the prices for each pack change accordingly.<br><br>
The code in the repository likely includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files responsible for creating the user interface elements, handling user interactions such as toggling between subscription packs and updating prices dynamically</p>
